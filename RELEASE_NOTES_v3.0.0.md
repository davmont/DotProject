# dotPulse 3.0.0 Release Notes

**Release date:** 2026-10-30

dotPulse 3.0.0 is the first release under the new name. It continues
[dotProject](https://github.com/dotproject/dotProject) (last upstream release 2.2.0, March 2020)
and this fork's own 2.3.x releases. It contains everything merged into `devel` since
v2.3.1: a complete security audit of the core and every bundled module, a PHP 8 audit
suite, the project tips bell, email notifications and many fixes.

The version jumps to 3.0.0 because some changes break things that worked in 2.3.1:
read **Breaking changes** and **Upgrading** before installing it on an existing site.
The database is still upgraded in place, from dotPulse/dotProject 2.3.1 and from
dotProject 2.x.

---

## Breaking changes

- **New name.** The product is now dotPulse, with a new logo and favicons. Page titles
  and the mail subject prefix change to dotPulse unless you had customised them.
  Internal names do not change: `dP*` functions, `$dPconfig`, `dotp_` tables and the
  module API stay as they were.
- **Content-Security-Policy is enforced.** Inline scripts, inline event handlers
  (`onclick=`...), `javascript:` URLs and `eval()` are blocked in the browser. Every
  bundled module has been converted. **Third-party modules that use inline JavaScript
  stop working** until they move their scripts to files or to `js/dp-actions.js`
  (`data-dp-*` attributes); see [docs/csp.md](docs/csp.md).
- **Changes need POST and a CSRF token.** Actions that used to change data through a
  plain link (GET) now need a form post with the session's token. Bookmarks or scripts
  that called such links stop working.
- **`queuescanner.php` runs from the command line only.** Over HTTP it answers 404.
  Change the cron job to
  `php /path/to/queuescanner.php --base-url=https://your-site` (see
  [docs/deployment-security.md](docs/deployment-security.md)). Notification,
  assignment and reminder emails are only sent by this job.
- **`includes/config.php` is no longer in the repository.** The installer writes it, or
  copy `includes/config-dist.php`. Keep your existing file when you replace the code.
- **Mantis module 1.0** talks to MantisBT through its REST API with a token per user,
  instead of XML-RPC. Each user enters their MantisBT API token once.
- **Password reset** emails a single-use link valid for one hour, instead of a new
  password.
- **Removed:** broken or unsafe leftovers. These include the jpgraph copy in
  monitoringandcontrol (charts use Chart.js), `install/docs/phpinfo.php`, the ticketsmith
  `admin.php` page, the tracIntegration XML-RPC demos and the milonic menu library
  (replaced by `js/dp-contextmenu.js`).

## Security

The audit and its fixes are documented in [docs/security-audit/](docs/security-audit/)
([ROADMAP.md](docs/security-audit/ROADMAP.md) lists every phase).

- SQL injection, stored and reflected XSS, missing permission checks and insecure direct
  object references fixed across the core and all add-on modules.
- CSRF protection on every form post and on writes that used GET.
- Enforced Content-Security-Policy with a per-request nonce and violation reports.
- File handling: path traversal and remote-code-execution sinks closed, server-side
  MIME detection for uploads.
- Installer: no unauthenticated configuration rewrite, `phpinfo()` page removed.
- Token-based password reset, rate-limited login and reset, hardened sessions.
- Dompdf 3.1.6 (six CVEs fixed in the bundled PDF library).
- Web server rules for Apache and nginx in
  [docs/deployment-security.md](docs/deployment-security.md).

## New

- **Project tips bell** (dotproject_plus 1.1): checks each project against PMBOK practice
  (charter, scope, schedule, cost, resources, risks) and suggests the next step. Users
  mark tips read per project.
- **Project charters linked to projects** (initiating 1.2), with charter checks in the
  bell.
- **Email notifications:**
  - an email when someone assigns you to a task, in your language (you can turn it off
    in your preferences);
  - a **sender address** setting so mail passes SPF/DMARC;
  - **Send a test email** in System Configuration;
  - SMTPS on port 465;
  - valid calendar invitations (`.ics`) for tasks.
- **Mantis integration** rebuilt on the MantisBT REST API.
- **Earned value** in monitoringandcontrol corrected (PV/EV/AC); overlapping cost periods
  are rejected.
- **Sample data** (`make sample-data`, `make sample-sql`): a consultancy with projects,
  tasks, risks and costs, for demos and testing.

## Fixes

- No PHP warnings, notices or SQL errors left in the full audit suite. It installs every
  module, crawls every page and saves every form as an administrator and as a regular
  user, in every theme.
- Costs and finances no longer share the `budget` table (costs 1.1 uses `costs_budget`).
- The event queue no longer stops at a failing event: queued task notifications crashed
  it on PHP 8, so no reminder behind them was ever sent.
- Saving a task with "Synchronize with the external calendar" no longer hangs the request.
- Upgrading to a new version now applies every pending database update. Before, the
  dated steps in `db/upgrade_latest.sql` only ran when the code version was unchanged.
- Helpdesk, Gantt, calendar, task dates and many module pages: PHP 8 errors and data
  loss fixed (details in the roadmap).

## Upgrading

1. **Back up** the database and the `files/` directory.
2. **Rehearse** on a copy if you can:
   `make rehearse DUMP=/path/to/dump.sql.gz ADMIN=<admin user>` upgrades the copy in the
   Docker sandbox, then checks the log and crawls every page
   ([docker/README.md](docker/README.md)).
3. **Replace the code.** Keep `includes/config.php` and `files/`.
4. **Run the installer** by opening `install/` in a browser. It detects the existing
   installation and applies the database updates. Then remove the `install/` directory
   or deny access to it.
5. **Upgrade the modules** in System Admin > Modules. Each module with a newer version
   shows "upgrade":

   | Module | From | To |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | costs | 1.0.1 | 1.1 |
   | finances | 1.0 | 1.1 |
   | human_resources | 1.0 | 1.1 |
   | testing | 1.0.0 | 1.0.1 |
   | initiating | 1.1 | 1.2 |
   | dotproject_plus | 1.0 | 1.1 (until then the tips bell is hidden) |
   | mantis | 0.2 | 1.0 (users then enter their MantisBT API token) |

6. **Cron:** run `queuescanner.php` from the command line every few minutes (see the
   breaking changes above).
7. **Mail:** set the sender address and use **Send a test email** in System Admin >
   System Configuration.
8. **Web server:** apply the rules in
   [docs/deployment-security.md](docs/deployment-security.md). This matters especially
   on nginx, which ignores the `.htaccess` files.
9. **Third-party modules:** check them with the browser console open; Content-Security-
   Policy violations are also logged to `files/temp/csp-reports.log`.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.x (8.3 is tested), MySQL or MariaDB.
- Apache (recommended) or nginx with the rules from the deployment guide.
