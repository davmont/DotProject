<p align="center"><strong>Open-source project management for PHP 8, continuing dotProject.</strong></p>

---

**dotPulse** is an actively maintained continuation of [dotProject](https://github.com/dotproject/dotProject),
the open-source, web-based project-management system. Upstream development stopped after
dotProject 2.2.0 (March 2020); this fork carries the code base forward. It runs on
PHP 8.x, ships a Material-style theme, adds PMBOK-oriented features and a full
Spanish translation, and has been through a complete security and code-quality audit.

The name keeps the *dot* and the **dP** initials that run through the code (`dPgetParam()`,
`$dPconfig`, `DP_BASE_DIR`): existing installations, add-on modules and their database
tables keep working unchanged.

## Status

Work happens on the **`devel`** branch; **`master`** only receives stable releases.

- Current stable release: **v2.3.1** (still named dotProject). See [RELEASE_NOTES_v2.3.1.md](RELEASE_NOTES_v2.3.1.md).
- Next release: **v2.4.0**, the first under the dotPulse name. It brings the security
  audit described below to `master`.

## What's in it

### Security
A module-by-module audit of the whole code base (core and every bundled add-on) is
documented in [docs/security-audit/](docs/security-audit/), with its roadmap in
[ROADMAP.md](docs/security-audit/ROADMAP.md). Highlights:

- Passwords hashed with `password_hash()` (bcrypt), upgraded transparently on login;
  token-based password reset; rate-limited login and reset.
- CSRF protection on every form post; actions that changed data over GET moved to POST.
- Enforced Content-Security-Policy with no inline scripts ([docs/csp.md](docs/csp.md)).
- SQL injection, XSS and missing-permission fixes across core and add-on modules.
- Hardened sessions (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`, id regenerated on login) and
  file uploads (server-side MIME detection).
- Deployment checklist in [docs/deployment-security.md](docs/deployment-security.md).

### PHP 8
The full audit suite installs every add-on module, crawls every page and saves every
form as an administrator and as a regular user, and fails on any PHP error, warning,
notice or SQL error.

### Project management
- **Project tips bell**: checks each project against PMBOK practice (charter, scope,
  schedule, cost, risks and more) and suggests the next step.
- **PMBOK 8th Edition** task fields (status, principles, domains) and project charters
  linked to their project (Initiating module).
- Gantt charts, calendar, Helpdesk, Mantis integration, costs and finances, timesheets,
  risks and the other dotProject modules, updated for PHP 8.

### Interface and languages
- Material theme by default; the classic themes are still available.
- Complete **Spanish** translation; the other upstream languages are kept.

## Installation

**Requirements:** PHP 8.x (8.3 is tested), MySQL or MariaDB, Apache (recommended) or nginx.
Several access rules rely on `.htaccess`; on nginx, port the equivalent `deny` rules
(see [docs/deployment-security.md](docs/deployment-security.md)).

1. Put the source in your web root.
2. Open the `install/` directory in a browser and follow the wizard. It writes
   `includes/config.php`; to configure by hand, copy
   [includes/config-dist.php](includes/config-dist.php) to `includes/config.php`.
3. After installing, remove the `install/` directory or deny access to it.

### Upgrading from dotProject
dotPulse upgrades dotProject 2.x databases in place: back up the database, replace the
code, and run the installer, which detects the existing installation and applies the
database upgrades. Then upgrade the add-on modules from **System Admin > Modules**.
Customised page titles and e-mail prefixes are kept; the defaults are renamed to dotPulse.

## Development

- `make check` runs the PHP lint, PHPStan, the raw-input and inline-script checks and
  the JavaScript tests.
- PHP unit tests: `php tests/cli_runner.php`. JavaScript tests (Jest, in
  [tools/jest/](tools/jest/)): `make js-test`.
- A Docker sandbox (PHP 8.3 and MariaDB) and the full audit suite are described in
  [docker/README.md](docker/README.md) (`make audit-full`).

Node.js is only needed for the development tools in [tools/](tools/); a server does not
need it.

## Brand

The logo, palette and favicons are in [images/brand/](images/brand/) and are generated
by [tools/brand/build.py](tools/brand/build.py). The mark is five dots, one per task,
drawing the pulse of a project.

| Colour | Hex | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dotPulse blue | `#1B4F9C` | Logo, links, buttons |
| Deep blue | `#123A73` | Hover, pressed |
| Coral | `#F06449` | The peak in the logo, charts (not small text) |
| Coral text | `#C93D27` | Coral for text on white |
| Teal | `#0A8080` | Second data colour, text on white |
| Graphite | `#23262B` | Body text, wordmark |
| Mist | `#E8EDF5` | Section backgrounds |

The wordmark uses [Space Grotesk](https://github.com/floriankarsten/space-grotesk)
(SIL Open Font License), converted to outlines.

## Origins and credits

dotPulse is built on the work of the dotProject Development Team and its contributors.
dotProject started in 2000 and was developed by its community for nearly two decades;
its last upstream release is 2.2.0 (March 2020). This fork began in January 2013 from
dotProject's Subversion code base and was renamed dotPulse in 2026.
