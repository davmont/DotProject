# dotProject v2.3.1 Release Notes

**Release date:** 2026-06-15

This is a security, performance, and localization patch release. It merges all work
from the `devel` branch into `master` and adds hardening found during a cloud security
review.

---

## Security fixes

- **Password hashing migration**: MD5 passwords are transparently upgraded to bcrypt on
  first login. New passwords use `password_hash()` with `PASSWORD_DEFAULT`.
- **CSRF protection**: Central `verifyCsrfToken()` check on all `dosql` dispatches;
  non-POST `dosql` requests are now rejected outright, closing the GET-based CSRF bypass.
- **Session hardening**: `session_regenerate_id(true)` on login; `HttpOnly` and `Secure`
  cookie flags; `SameSite=Lax`; `Secure` now correctly detected behind reverse proxies
  by reading the configured `base_url` scheme.
- **XSS fixes**: URL parameters wrapped in `intval()` in HR allocations, view roles,
  timeplanning, inventory utility, and communication addedit.
- **SQL injection fixes**: Parameterized or `intval()`-guarded queries in calendar event
  delete/query, mileage log, `CTesting::delete()`, timecard date, annotations addedit,
  and user-lookup in sendpass.
- **`unserialize()` hardened**: `['allowed_classes' => false]` added to PostNuke
  authenticator.
- **File upload MIME detection**: Server-side `finfo` detection; falls back to
  `application/octet-stream` instead of the client-supplied Content-Type value when
  finfo is unavailable.
- **Rate limiting**: File-based rate limiter on login and password-reset endpoints
  (`classes/ratelimiter.class.php`).
- **`echo db_error()` removed**: Database error details no longer exposed in HTTP
  responses.
- **New-user email**: Plaintext password removed from new-user notification; users are
  directed to the password-reset flow instead.

## Bug fixes

- **Gantt chart**: Fixed fatal `TypeError` on `count(null)` when a project has no tasks.
- **Project form**: Fixed null-access warning on `$criticalTasks` when creating a new
  project; fixed `noCompanies` error message incorrectly using `append=true`.
- **Calendar entities**: Replaced HTML entity hack with a proper decoding utility.
- **jscalendar**: Implemented missing `strftime` format specifiers (`%T`, `%R`, `%X`,
  `%r`, `%E`, `%F`, `%G`, `%g`, `%h`).
- **Old password check**: `!empty()` guard added before comparing passwords in user edit
  and change-password flows; `fetchRow()` used in `chpwd.php` for cleaner null handling.

## Performance

- N+1 query loops eliminated with bulk inserts / ADOdb transactions across: Tasks,
  Task Assigned Users deletion, Resource Manager projects loop, ATA controller, Calendar
  event assignment, Minute Members insertion, Project Contacts/Departments bulk insert,
  Contact↔Company upgrade, Project deletion, Task budget & child-count loading.
- Contacts search filter string concatenation optimised.
- Task dependency updates batched with `REPLACE INTO`.

## PMBOK 8th Edition

- New task-level **Status** field (table column `task_status`) for PMBOK-aligned
  project tracking.

## Localization

- **76 missing translation keys** added across all 25 supported locales.
- 8 modules that previously had no locale files now have them:
  `communication`, `messages`, `mileagelog`, `tasks_template`, `unitcost`,
  `timesheet`, `finances`, `closure`.
- Cross-cutting keys (`Assign`, `Unassign`, `Loading`, `Send`, `Dependency`,
  `Parent task`, `weeks ago`, etc.) added to `common.inc` for every locale.
- **Spanish (`es`)**: Full translations for all new keys; iGantt locale fully
  translated (previously used English fallbacks for 40+ strings).

## Code health

- Deprecated `checkFlag()` removed from `includes/permissions.php`.
- Commented-out dead code purged from bugspray, gantt PDF, cronograma, projects tab,
  and monitoring & control modules.
- `CDpObject::bind()` test coverage improved.
- `DBQuery::setLimit()`, `addLimit()`, `sanitise()`, `addTable()` test coverage added.
- GACL self-repair on upgrade: auto-restores missing `gacl_acl_sections` table.

## Database upgrade

The installer's `upgrade_latest.php` will automatically apply:

| Date | Change |
|------|--------|
| `20260531` | `users.user_password` widened to `VARCHAR(255)` for bcrypt hashes |
| `20260615` | `gacl_acl_sections` table created (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`) |

## Upgrade path

Update `versions.inc.php` now includes `2.3.0` → `2.3.1`. Run the installer upgrade
wizard or apply `db/upgrade_latest.php` manually.

## Known outstanding issues

See [README.md](README.md) for the full module status list. Several legacy modules
(Helpdesk, Ticketing, Finances, third-party integrations) have not been fully tested
against PHP 8.x and the Material theme.
